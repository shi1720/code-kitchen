"""The nudge engine — sales-cadence discipline for a job search.

Cloud Scheduler hits ``POST /api/tasks/nudge-scan`` on a fixed schedule;
this module decides who deserves a nudge. Four rules, all deterministic
and all visible to the user in the UI (no black box):

- ``follow_up``           Applied and quiet for too long → nudge with an
                          auto-drafted follow-up email attached. Runs as a
                          3-touch cadence with backoff (5, 7, 10 days by
                          default).
- ``interview_thank_you`` Moved to Interview → send a thank-you within a day.
- ``offer_response``      Offer in hand → respond before it ages.
- ``reject_feedback``     Rejected → ask for feedback, turn a no into intel.

Idempotency is structural: every nudge has a deterministic ``dedupe_key``
and the repo refuses duplicates, so the scan can run hourly and retry
freely without ever double-nudging anyone.
