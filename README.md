## The problem

Three out of four candidates report being ghosted after an interview ([Greenhouse candidate
experience survey](https://www.greenhouse.com/blog/candidate-experience-report)) — and that's the
applications that got a reply at all. Not because candidates aren't good, but because nobody
*works* their applications. They apply, they wait, they lose track in a spreadsheet.

Sales teams solved this exact problem decades ago: a pipeline with stages, automated cadences,
and follow-ups that go out on schedule, every time. **OfferLoop gives job seekers that same
engine.**

## What it does

| | |
|---|---|
| **Pipeline board** | Drag applications through Applied → Interview → Offer / Reject. Every transition is recorded with a timestamped, annotated history. |
| **AI outreach that sounds like you** | Gemini **3.1 Pro** writes cover letters; **3.7 Flash** writes follow-ups — grounded on the posting, your profile, *and your own past drafts*, retrieved by hybrid semantic + lexical search. Every draft shows its provenance ("grounded on 3 past drafts"). |
| **Scheduled nudges** | **Cloud Scheduler** scans every pipeline hourly. Quiet applications trigger a 3-touch follow-up cadence (5 → 7 → 10 days) with the follow-up email *already drafted and attached*. Interviews trigger thank-you nudges; offers and rejections get their own rules. Idempotent by construction — a rerun never double-nudges. |
| **Bulk CSV ingestion** | Drop postings (`id, from, to, type, description`) and drafts (`id, jobId, type, contents, status`). Gemini Flash structures free-text descriptions in batched calls, drafts link to postings by `jobId`, orphans are kept and flagged, bad rows are rejected individually with reasons, and re-imports update instead of duplicating. |
| **Funnel analytics** | Interview rate, offer rate, median days-to-interview, ghost rate, weekly momentum — your search measured like a sales funnel. |

## Architecture

One container. One Cloud Run service. Scales to zero when nobody is job hunting at 3 a.m. — and
wakes the moment Cloud Scheduler fires.

    subgraph run [Cloud Run — one container]

        SCHED[Cloud Scheduler<br/>hourly, OIDC-signed]
    end

**Design decisions that matter:**

- **Adapter seams everywhere.** Storage (`Firestore ⇄ in-memory`), intelligence
  (`Gemini ⇄ deterministic templates`), and auth (`Firebase ⇄ demo identity`) are swappable via
  one env var. That's why the entire product — including the evaluation pipeline — runs and is
  tested in CI with zero credentials, then switches to full GCP with `OFFERLOOP_APP_MODE=live`.
- **Model routing with a fallback chain.** High-volume structured work (posting extraction,
  follow-ups) goes to `gemini-3.7-flash`; the highest-stakes artifact — the cover letter — goes to
  `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`. Every call degrades along
  `3.1 Pro → 3.6 Flash → 3.5 Flash-Lite` instead of failing, and extraction falls back to regex so a
  model outage can never break an import.
- **Idempotency as structure, not discipline.** Nudges are keyed by deterministic dedupe keys and
  the store refuses duplicates; CSV rows carry their external id so re-imports update in place.
  Scheduler retries and judge re-runs are harmless by design.
- **The demo seed *is* the evaluation pipeline.** Demo mode boots by ingesting
  [`data/sample_postings.csv`](data/sample_postings.csv) and
  [`data/sample_drafts.csv`](data/sample_drafts.csv) through the exact same importer the
  evaluators will exercise. No hand-planted fixtures.

## Try it in 60 seconds (no GCP account needed)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shi1720/code-kitchen.git && cd code-kitchen
make install     # backend venv + frontend npm install
make build       # production frontend bundle
make api         # http://localhost:8000 — demo workspace, seeded via the CSV pipeline
```

Or with Docker — exactly what Cloud Run runs:

```bash
make docker && make docker-run    # http://localhost:8080
```

Click **Enter OfferLoop** and you're inside a seeded workspace: 12 imported postings, 16
historical drafts, and a live nudge inbox. Then go to **Import** and hit **Load sample datasets →
Run import** to watch the evaluation pipeline run end to end — and hit it again to see
idempotency in action.

> Demo mode keeps everything in memory (restart = fresh seed) and uses a deterministic writer,
> so it needs zero credentials. Live mode is the same code on Firestore + Gemini, flipped by
> one env var.

## Deploying to Google Cloud

```bash
PROJECT_ID=your-project ./infra/deploy.sh
```

The script enables APIs, creates Firestore, sets up least-privilege service accounts, deploys to
Cloud Run from source, and wires the hourly Cloud Scheduler job (OIDC-authenticated). Full
runbook with the Firebase Auth step: [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

## For evaluators

**[docs/EVALUATION.md](docs/EVALUATION.md)** maps every requirement in the problem statement to
the code, tests, and the exact `curl`/UI path to verify it — including how to run your own CSV
datasets through the pipeline.

## Testing

```bash
make test    # 70 backend tests (pytest) + 5 frontend tests (vitest)
make lint    # ruff + tsc --noEmit
make tour    # Playwright end-to-end tour of the full UI (needs `make api` running)
```

The importer is tested against the messy realities of the evaluation schema: unquoted commas
inside descriptions (as in the problem statement's own examples), `<id>`-style angle-bracket
headers, UTF-8 BOM, CRLF, multiline quoted contents, mixed date formats, messy type labels
(`follow-up`, `Thank You`, `fulltime`), duplicate ids within one file, per-row failures,
idempotent re-imports, and orphan adoption when a posting arrives after its drafts. The nudge
engine is tested for cadence backoff, dedupe idempotency, budget caps, and the staleness-clock
semantics. The Playwright tour in [`e2e/`](e2e/) click-tests every page against the running
stack and regenerates the screenshots above.

## Commercial viability

Job-search CRMs like Teal and Huntr already have paying users in the US; the "cadence" mechanic —
borrowed from sales tools like Outreach — is the wedge none of the spreadsheet-replacement tools
have. India makes the problem *worse* and the opportunity bigger: mass-apply culture on Naukri
and LinkedIn means more pipelines, more silence, more ghosting. The roadmap follows the market:
one-click import from Naukri/LinkedIn, nudges delivered on WhatsApp, a ₹99/month premium tier —
and, because Indian B2C rarely pays alone, **placement-cell and bootcamp licensing as the B2B2C
channel** (a college buys OfferLoop for 2,000 final-year students and gets the recruiter-facing
funnel analytics).

The infrastructure is the business model's friend: scale-to-zero Cloud Run + Firestore free tier
+ Flash-first model routing puts the marginal cost of a free user near zero.
